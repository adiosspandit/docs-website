title: 'Include a doc in multiple menus'
---

If you have a document that should appear in multiple menus, you can include the same path in multiple taxonomy locations. (We sometimes refer to this casually as a "dummy doc.")

For example, if you wanted to link to the APM landing page from another location of taxonomy (such as a differnt taxonomy level, a different category, etc.), youâ€™d add a new entry in the navigation YAML file (for example, `/src/nav/agents.yml`).

In this example, we add a link to the Ruby agent installation doc from the Distributed tracing category. You can now access this doc from either the Distributed tracing category or the Ruby agent category.
```

    path: /docs/distributed-tracing
