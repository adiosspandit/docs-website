Browser uses a [JavaScript snippet](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing/instrumentation-page-load-timing), also referred to as an "agent," to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options.

## Enable browser monitoring [#enable]

To enable browser: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, select **Browser**, and then select **Add more data**. The UI gives you instructions. 

Some notes about this process: 
* It can take several minutes after enabling the agent for data to show up in New Relic. 
* If you are doing the copy/paste method, see [Copy/paste option](#copy-paste-app) for tips. 
* If you're having trouble, see [Troubleshooting](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-your-browser-monitoring-installation).
* After enabling, you can configure the agent on the [**App settings** page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/browser-app-settings-page). 
* For other questions, see the remainder of this doc. 

## Browser agent types - Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA [#agent-types]

We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. Note that the agent type has no impact on your billing. Details about the agent types: 

* Pro+SPA: This is the default installed agent when using the [enable procedures](#enable). This gives you access to the [Browser Pro features](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features) and to [Single Page App (SPA) monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/introduction-single-page-app-monitoring/). This agent is beneficial for getting detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features (like [distributed tracing](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/browser-data-distributed-tracing)) for all types of applications: it is not only for use by single page applications. After install, you have the option to downgrade to the less advanced agents.  
* Pro: Gives you access to the [Browser Pro features](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features).
* Lite: Gives you information about some basic page load timing and browser user information, but lacks the Browser Pro features and SPA features.

Details about how agent types relate to pricing: 

* [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing): This pricing plan has data ingest as a billing factor, so you may have a desire to downgrade to lesser agent types after install to reduce data ingest. 
* [Original pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing): Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent. 

After the initial install of the agent, you can go to the [**App settings** page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/browser-app-settings-page) to edit configuration. 


## Deployment options [#options]

No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is that the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet (also referred to as the "agent") is inserted into your app pages. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the [Browser **Application settings** page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/browser-settings-ui-options-apdex-geography) to update settings.

        When [enabling browser monitoring](#enable), one deployment option is to use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your [APM **Applications** index](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/viewing-your-applications-list).)

      <td>
        When [enabling browser monitoring](#enable), one deployment option is to manually copy and paste the browser agent JavaScript snippet into your app's web pages, which gives you control over the exact placement of it. This is useful for:

        * Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN
        * APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end)

        For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically.

        The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps.

## Enable an APM-monitored app [#select-apm-app]

One of the [deployment options](#options) is to enable browser monitoring for an app that's already being monitored by a New Relic APM agent. For how to do that, see [Enable monitoring](#enable). 


## Enable with copy/paste [#copy-paste-app]

One of the [deployment options](#options) is to insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. To get started, see [Enable monitoring](#enable).

Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: 

* Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the `<head>` element as possible, but after any position-sensitive `<meta>` tags (for example, `X-UA-Compatible` or `charset` information). For more information on the inline `head` placement, see [JavaScript placement requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/instrumentation-browser-monitoring#javascript-placement).
* Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the [REST API](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/browser-examples-v2) and [API Explorer](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/api-explorer-v2/getting-started-new-relics-api-explorer).


## Instrument webpages using the APM agent [#agent-instrumentation]

This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM.

New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you are using an APM agent's API to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's [AJAX calls](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/dashboard-details/ajax-dashboard) and [JavaScript errors](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/dashboard-details/javascript-errors-dashboard).

For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent:

* [C SDK](/docs/agents/c-sdk/instrumentation/guide-using-c-sdk-api/#browser)
* [Go](/docs/agents/go-agent/features/install-new-relic-browser-go-apps)
* [Java](/docs/agents/java-agent/instrumentation/page-load-timing-java)

* [Ruby](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/features/page-load-timing-ruby)

## Troubleshoot browser agent installation [#troubleshooting]

When you [enable browser monitoring](#enable), it may take approximately five minutes to see that data in New Relic. If you have problems, see [Troubleshooting](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/troubleshooting-browser-monitoring).
